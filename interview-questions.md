# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Good question. A parameter is a placeholder for the value, it isn't the value itself as it is the middle man in a way. An argument is the value that we want to invoke. 

Researched answer: A parameter is the function name's definitions or placeholders. A parameter is the category while an argument is the value. For example a parameter is a,b and when we execute the code during the console log we want to invoke a,b by using using numbers 5,10 (we are adding these two numbers in this instance) those are the arguments or the values to the parameters and when the console log is ran we would return 15. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: Great question. The value, index, array are the three predefined paramaters for the .map() method. The value would be one of the six primitive data types (boolean, number, string, null, undefined, and or symbol). The value is a mandatory part of the array while the index and array are not. The index could be a specified number ([1]) indiciating what index of the value were trying to access or it could simply be a number (7). 

Researched answer: The value, index, and array are the predefined parameters and the only required parameter is the value. The array is the array of the current element (value). 

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Good question. The .map() method is iterating through an object, array, or string and returning a new array with the exact same length. The .filter() method iterates through an object, array, or string until the condition is satisified or the condition is met. 

Researched answer: I was correct with my definitions. To add onto the .filter() method, the .filter() method needs something to evaluate such as a truthy or falsy, or a boolean (true or false) answer. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Good question. Iteration is the repitition over a string, number, or array that won't stop until the condition is satisfied and executed. 

Researched answer: The process of repeating an asked upon action until that action is completed or satisifed by the condition set. 

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: Great question. What I do know is that, a class is category with subcategories that has objects attached to it. A class also has a constructor which at this time I'm drawing a blank on. However, and object has key value pairs attached to them. While they cannot be called upon they are the placeholders or blueprint foundation for an object. 

Researched answer: Objects are key value pairs that are stored in curly braces. They cannot be called upon without having dot notation to access the variable name and the key value pair. A class is the blueprint to the object. A class has three different keywords the classes name, the constructor, the this., and the new. The classes name which is PascalCased meaning the first letter is capital, for example, a class called PetNames, the p will be capitalized and the n. The second syntax is the constructor which is the access we need to create a new object and set values for those objects. Lastly, the new is the new object we are creating for the class. Also, classes and objects are reuseable.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: That is a great question, and at this time I do not have an answer for you, can you please explain what that is and I will be sure to do research on this specific defintion. 

Researched answer: A variable can be used before it was declared. This could be a letter is assigned a number. It is the default behavior for Javascript to move all declared variables to the top of the scope which means in the beginning inside a function. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: It is the end goal of a users expectancies. 

2. Spread operator: It is a new operator that came apart of ES6. It is an easy way of copying objects. It's syntax is three periods (...) followed by the funciton name. 

3. React: It is a Javascript library created by Facebook. It's a user interface (UI) library and also a tool to build UI components. 

4. React props: Arguments passed into React components. 

5. DOM events: Allow Javascript to register different even handlers on elements in an HTML document.
